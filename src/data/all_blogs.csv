Google has confirmed that the change is now rolling out to all searches in all languages worldwide. It has been said the ads will not be displayed on the right side of desktop. But there are two exceptions: First, Product Listing Ad (PLA) boxes and second, ads in knowledge panel. Product Listing Ad boxes are those which display either above or to the right of the search results. Another source from Google informs that PLA boxes are going to be the only time ads which will be shown continuously on the right side of the desktop. Finally Google has confirmed that the prior information is correct. There will be two exceptions as mentioned above.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The additional fourth ad will be meant for only highly commercial queries. This addition of fourth ad may involve searches such as “hostels in New York City”, “car insurance” etc.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">This removal of right side ads makes desktop searches look like mobile search results. On mobile search result, Google shows two or three ads at the top of the search results.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Google has stated in a statement to “The Verge” that they were working on testing this layout for some time. The company has also claimed that their new layout will provide more relevant results to the people who are searching on Google and it will also better the performance of the advertisers.</p>",,"February 22, 2016",/assets/imgs/blog/Google-–-Stop-Displaying-Ads-on-Right-Side-of-SERP.jpg,Uncategorized,adwords|google updates|sem,Google - Stop Displaying Ads on Right Side of SERP - Uniterrene Websoft,Google is announcing a dramatic change by removing ads from the right side of the SERP.

9,SEO & PR Strategies Followed by Best SEO Companies,Uniterrene,"<p align=""justify"">It is the latest trend of the <a href=""https://www.uniterrene.com/search-engine-optimization/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>best SEO companies</strong></a> to integrate digital marketing and communication channels for an amazing result.  It is known to all that standard content and outreach is an indispensable part of unique SEO services. These two things are well known to PR as well. There are some factors which help the two different teams to achieve a common business goal. These factors are education, optimization of links, media outreach, aligning messages, Sharing and amplifying content etc.</p>
<strong>Education</strong>
<p align=""justify"">It is easy to work on one’s area of expertise. But the task becomes quote difficult when one has to work with other teams, specialized in other fields. PR professionals are not used to with the impact online earned media may have on SEO and keyword rankings. Therefore, while working with the PR teams, SEO team should educate the PRs about the matter. Short sessions should be arranged in few weeks to provide the PRs proper knowledge of SEO.</p>
<p align=""justify"">On the other hand, PR s should train the other team as well. Though media outreach is a part Search engine optimization and content marketing, usually they do not have expertise on this.</p>
<strong>Optimization of links</strong>
<p align=""justify"">SEO team should guide the PR team to optimize the links in all the media coverage which they deal like non-paid stories or company press releases. Links should be chosen which have the keywords, essential for top ranking. PRs should be trained to put the right URL to the proper link.  The two teams should consult together to assure that any links belonging to paid sponsorships are nofollowed. This needs to be done to avoid any kind of search engine penalty.</p>
<strong>Media Outreach</strong>
<p align=""justify"">Influencer outreach is a crucial element in any marketing strategy. It depends on the size of a company. No one wants multiple people of a same company reaching out to the influencer. It generates confusion in the bloggers, writers, media manager if they are receiving different requests from different people in the same company. To overcome this confusion, a guideline should be set for the different types of people of that company who are trying to reach out to an influencer. For instance, the PR team should own the relationship with mass media outlets when the digital marketing team owns the relationships with bloggers and writers.</p>
<p align=""justify"">When multiple teams are trying outreach, it is natural that one will get multiple stories and messages at the same time. Therefore, the SEO and PR teams should be aligned on the broader messaging and timing to ensure it that the brand is putting out a similar theme of content and not confounding the messages or promoting two different kinds of things at a same time.</p>
<strong>Sharing and amplifying content</strong>
<p align=""justify"">Generating content is not an easy task. This is a task which both SEO and PR team do but for two entirely different audiences. The content word should be made harder by sharing something that’s been created already that other groups or teams can pull from.  This combine effort of the two teams help to influence more KPIs which better report how their activities are influencing multiple segments of the business.</p>

16,Now You can Find AMPs Indexed in Organic Search Results,Uniterrene,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Haven’t you heard of the latest changes announced by Google last week? Like all the announcements made by the giant company, this one has already excited the world. The buzz is that Google is going to roll out AMP pages in organic search results worldwide.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Google has been working sincerely to make the user experience of the web faster for everyone with the introduction of AMP or Accelerated Mobile Pages technology. In this February, Google included a ‘top stories’ carousel containing pages developed with AMP technology in support of AMP.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Later, in the month of August, everyone got a hint from Google that their next step will be initiated with respect to AMP pages. Google made a statement that they would include the AMP pages in the regular set of organic search results. The time is now knocking the door. Yes, this is the time when Google is going to implement their statement.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>What’s in the stock for the publishers?</strong>
When you will search anything on your mobile, the Google search results will automatically default to displaying the AMP version of a page (obviously if it is available). This change indicates a significant amount of new exposures for AMP pages, most probably leading to more traffic, revenue so on. If you are a publisher and not yet using AMP, this change would put you in a challenging situation to adopt this technology. People should not take AMP as a ranking signal. So far as raking of the content is concerned, page load time is a key factor no doubt. When the average time of AMP pages is less than one second, it would give them advantages over those pages which are coded in regular HTML. Generally, the HTML coded pages take an average time of 19 seconds to load and spends 10 times as much data.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>What’s in the stock for the searchers?</strong>
This change is really beneficial for the searchers as it will save the time of searching on Google (when they are searching with mobile device). When you are searching with a cellular connection, it would be helpful in saving data as well. And good news for the searchers is that they will get more access to AMP pages in comparison to the previous conditions.</p>

 	<li><strong>According To the Products / Services Offered: </strong></li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For green and environmental products, it is generally recommended not to use orange or red tones, as it might convey different message. Instead of going to the family of Reds, it is always recommended to use earth tones and green colors. The key to make our website preferred by audiences is to choose colors as per the service and products offered.</p>

<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
 	<li><strong>Decide Targeted Audience: </strong></li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">While we give complete attention on the color as per the products, most of the designers tend to forget considering their targeted audience.

An ideal SEO expert will always be updated and well-informed about latest tricks and strategies.</p>

<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
 	<li><strong>Low ambition:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">All know that standard SEO will be costly.

Without the presence of online with supreme features of the website, the visitors will not be interested in visiting the page. What are the issues that an old website faces today? Why your newly made website should be <strong>website restructured</strong>? Let’s lean a little bit-
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>The issues for which a website is redesigned:</strong></p>
<img class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-1119"" src=""https://www.uniterrene.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/graphic_design21-300x195.png"" alt=""website re-structured"" width=""300"" height=""195"" />

<strong>The exact view on the modern system</strong> is a vital matter. The old website was not made for HD (high definition screen). But, most of the systems are made with HD display and even the smartphones are also supportive of HD and full HD services. So, if your website is not of HD enabled, you have to transfer to the HD pages.

&nbsp;

<strong>The responsive website </strong>is highly essential for the new trend of online marketing. If your website is only compatible for the desktop or laptop, you cannot create a wider customer base. It is not possible to sit on front of the desktop and search for purchasing an electronic gadget or buying a passionate dress for you. So, you have to optimize your website to the responsive website. This feature enables you to access more easily to the smartphones whatever its screen size is.

&nbsp;

<strong>Mobile friendly website </strong>is also a similar kind of website that opens the page on the small screened device with the addition of “m” (e.g. m.example.com) at its primary position of the URL. It is better to use responsive website where there is not URL change.

&nbsp;

<strong>Content update </strong>is also a great matter of fact. The use of images, videos and texts should be confirmed after a certain point of time. The thing is that, the old and odd image on the pages, the videos or banner images of the pages should be regularly up-to-date.

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""color: #ff6600;""><strong>Use of keywords</strong></span></p>
One of the most important factors of any SEO campaign is the keywords. If you use the wrong keywords, your target users may never appear on your page through any search engine. So, it is really important to establish your business objectives clearly before designing the website. Once you know the objectives and decide on the target niche, it becomes easier to set your keywords.
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""color: #ff6600;""><strong>Keywords placing</strong></span></p>
If you want to integrate your page successfully into a search engine, you need to describe what the particular page is all about. So, it is very important to position the keywords in the right locations of the page.

This means that you need to create a structure for your website which any search engine can follow. A major reason why a search engine might fail to find your website is the fact that the links are placed on the images instead of texts. So, make sure all the links you post are text-based.
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""color: #ff6600;""><strong>Filenames and URLs</strong></span></p>
Your URL must be SEO-optimized, i.e., the search engine should be able to identify the contents of the page quickly.

34,Progressive Web Apps – Why to Use,Uniterrene,"Web or mobile applications need to be upgraded to stay relevant with time. PWA or Progressive Web Apps are a concept that insists to enrich the mobile-using experiences for the users. The concept of PWA begins with a reliable and faster web app-like experience through mobile browsers. While the users need to search an app in the Playstore and download for using (this sometimes affects the user interaction ratio as many of the users choose not to download or use the apps to avoid complications), PWA apps can start directly as soon as the users click on those.

&nbsp;

<strong>How it works</strong>

&nbsp;

Progressive Web Apps are modified in an advanced way, so load faster. The sites are responsive for all sorts of mobile devices and can be loaded offline as well. This will be beneficial because such activities help the users to keep with the track of their works over periods. The cached data can be accessed at ease (even while offline) to maintain the relentless flow of work.

&nbsp;

The most progressive approach for PWA is that, Google indexes the site-contents and each of the pages has a URL that can be accessed through cache. The contents appear properly and do not create visual hazards. Moreover, responsive activities of the sites allow them to access through desktop, tablets and phones.

&nbsp;

There are several advanced features and responses of the PWA appear as useful and pleasing for the users. As these apps do not consume much time to turn on and get into action, modern people may precisely use them. Moreover, actions like native mobile apps (as PWA saves data in the “app-shell”) and attractive UI allow these apps to perform better.

&nbsp;

<strong>Positive effects</strong>

&nbsp;

Better service quality using a lower amount of data is something that users always appreciate. This also increase user experiences and profits the business. In fact, it can help SEO services as well.

&nbsp;

There are some tricks needed to follow for optimizing PWA-

&nbsp;

A crawl-able content

Testing the sites through many browsers

Measuring the load-performances

Accessible through all browsers

Independent actions even without internet connectivity

There is no hardware restriction

&nbsp;

Considering these actions, eminent developers associated with various different search engines have appreciated the approaches of PWA or <a href=""https://www.uniterrene.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Progressive Web Apps</strong></a>. At the places where mobile data usage is expensive, users may still render the PWA there. However, modifications over the time are required to take the whole process forward.",,"February 03, 2017",/assets/imgs/blog/Progressive-Web-Apps-–-Why-to-Use.jpg,mobile apps,mobile apps|Progressive Web Apps,Find Out Why to Use Progressive Web Apps,Do you know how the Progressive Web Apps work?

35,SEO Mistakes – Know What You Should Avoid to Increase Rank,Uniterrene,"The first month of 2017 is already over. Most of us have already started disremembering the New Year resolutions. However, neglecting the resolutions taken about SEO may have severe impact on the working process. This piece of discussion is about to focus some SEO mistakes that may hamper the rank of websites in the long run.

&nbsp;

<strong>Concept 1</strong>

The primary misconception is that the content will start showing the ranking without optimization.

&nbsp;

<strong>Mistake</strong>

Content marketing cannot help the website alone. No one can rule out the urgency for an on-page SEO. That is important to get the page to some rank.

&nbsp;

<strong>Concept 2</strong>

An awesome content will get links itself, without any effort for link building.

&nbsp;

<strong>Mistake</strong>

It is not an impossible factor, but in order to optimize the content, one requires putting some efforts for link building. In fact, link building can assure proper optimization for your site as well as content and promote them for attracting links, local citations in maximum number and PR.

&nbsp;

<a href=""https://www.uniterrene.com/search-engine-optimization/""><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1279 size-full"" src=""https://www.uniterrene.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/SEO-Mistakes-1.jpg"" alt=""Seo consultant"" width=""700"" height=""400"" /></a>

<strong>Concept 3</strong>

A good content needs no promotion

&nbsp;

<strong>Mistake</strong>

This is a bad choice indeed. A good content requires optimization for drawing attention of the targeted customers. Contents, which lack intentional distribution, may affect the page ranking.

&nbsp;

<strong>Concept 4</strong>

Spam linking to gain the attention of the viewers.

&nbsp;

<strong>Mistake</strong>

On the contrary, more spam linking means adverse effects on the site. As a result, the site may get negative attention that will never let it reach to the targeted customers. Mistakes like offering payments for links (in the terms of money and work) may be as bad as spam linking.

&nbsp;

<strong>Concept 5</strong>

A short, pointless content will gain the attention of people.

&nbsp;

<strong>Mistake</strong>

A large content has more chances to gather more viewers because they can be optimized in a proper way (using keywords and other SEO tools). However, a short content may also gather the attention of the viewers. Creating a pointless content is meaningless because that may create adverse effects or negative ranking for the site.

&nbsp;

<strong>Concept 6</strong>

Concentrating on the social media pages even more than links

&nbsp;

<strong>Mistake</strong>

Though social media are highly effective nowadays, it is not the substitute for link building process. Link building has a greater impact on the website rank. Therefore, ignoring it may actually affect the improvement of the ranking process.

&nbsp;

These are fewer mistakes those hamper the businesses nowadays. It will be wise for the business owners to <a href=""https://www.uniterrene.com/digital-marketing/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>consult SEO experts</strong></a> and avoid these mistakes for taking the business forward.",,"February 06, 2017",/assets/imgs/blog/SEO-Mistakes-–-Know-What-You-Should-Avoid-to-Increase-Rank.jpg,SEO,Increase Rank|seo mistakes,Common SEO Mistakes to Avoid for Maintaining Your Ranking,Are you making these SEO mistakes that can hamper the improvement in your search engine rankings?

57,Tips on Celebrating a Safe Diwali with Your Friends & Family,Uniterrene,"<strong>Diwali</strong> is a festival of lights that bring fun, joy, and togetherness with the closed and beloved ones. This festival is celebrated with great pomp and show in different parts of India especially North India. Children and youth look forward to the arrival of the festival with enthusiasm. In fact, everyone loves playing with firecrackers and lighting up the diyas or the small earthen lamps.

<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1488"" src=""https://www.uniterrene.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/diwali15.jpg"" alt=""diwali15"" width=""600"" height=""400"" />

Diwali marks the triumph of good over evil and dispels darkness. Unfortunately, improper handling and playing with fireworks may spoil the festive mood of your family. So today on behalf of Uniterrene, we will share some thoughts and tips on how you can celebrate a safe Diwali with your beloved ones. These points are mentioned as below:
<ol>
 	<li>An adult should always accompany children before they begin to play with fireworks.</li>
 	<li>Check the area before igniting fireworks to ensure that there are no inflammable and combustible materials in the vicinity.</li>
 	<li>Follow all safety precautions issued with the fireworks. Do not allow or use extra flammable fireworks.</li>
 	<li>Use a candle or an agarbatti to light up the fireworks.</li>
 	<li>Keep a fire extinguisher or bucket of water nearby to tackle any emergency fire hazards.</li>
 	<li>Keep burn ointments handy. They will act as an emergency first-aid kit.</li>
 	<li>Use fireworks only outdoors. You should strictly avoid fireworks indoor. They are extremely dangerous.</li>
 	<li>Wear protective goggles while lighting fireworks to prevent eye injuries. Consult an ophthalmologist immediately in case of eye injuries.</li>
 	<li>Light only one firework at a time.</li>
 	<li>Avoid high sound intensity firecrackers. They not only cause air pollution but also cause noise pollution and put a negative impact on living things.</li>
 	<li>Firecrackers, bombs, and flowerpots should not be lighted holding them. It is always safer to light them from the side without bending over them.</li>
 	<li>Move away quickly before they burst. Else, they can cause severe burn injuries.</li>
 	<li>Keep lighted sparklers away from the body.</li>
 	<li>Flying fireworks - rockets, missiles, etc. - should always be lighted in open grounds pointing straight up. Triple neck the bottle tops. One slight wrong angle can make a huge difference.</li>
 	<li>Dispose of the used fireworks immediately.</li>
 	<li>Wear close-fitting clothes of thick material instead of loose garments.</li>
 	<li>Store fireworks in a cool and dry place.</li>
 	<li>Never give fireworks to small children under 5 years of age.</li>
 	<li>Never ignite fireworks while holding them. Put them down, then ignite them and walk away. It might lead to burns and injuries to your hand.</li>
 	<li>Do not put fireworks in any container to ignite. It might explode and hurt nearby peoples.</li>
 	<li>Never mix anything with the contents of fireworks or make fireworks at home. This is illegal by law. Firecrackers without proper or wrong chemical composition can lead to a destructive scenario.</li>
 	<li>Never ignite aerial fireworks where there are overhead obstructions (trees, wires, etc.). These may interrupt the trajectory of the fireworks from going into an open airspace.</li>
 	<li>Never use fireworks inside a vehicle. It can cause accidents.</li>
 	<li>Never try to re-light a firework that has not burnt properly. Wait for 15 to 20 minutes and then soak it in a bucket of water. Sometimes, firecrackers can explode several minutes later.</li>
 	<li>Never throw or point fireworks at other people. Have a safe Diwali and let other people stay safe. After all, Diwali is a festival of lights, joy, and happiness.</li>
 	<li>Never carry fireworks in your pocket. In addition, do not allow your children or people around you to do so.</li>
 	<li>Never shoot fireworks into metal or glass containers. When glass explodes it might turn into shrapnel and thereby, end up in hurting and injuring peoples around you.</li>
</ol>
Following these precautions can help you to go a long way in ensuring a safe Diwali. Share this message with your beloved ones and let everyone have a safe and a joyful Diwali.

61,How to Pick the Best Company for Your Website Development,Uniterrene,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In this digital era, a website is the biggest thing that influences conversion in businesses!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If you are an established business owner, then you might be aware of how online presence can help you grow exponentially.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Having a website will open up new avenues for a business to acquire new customers and get sales. Most importantly, your business will become a globally recognised entity with the launch of a website.</p>
Definitely, you will need assistance from an expert <a href=""https://www.uniterrene.com/web-development/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>website development company</strong></a> that will build a website keeping in mind your business goals. A well-built website with a great look, fast loading speed, and good user experience will help you win more customers and see your sales soaring high.
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">However, picking the best web development company or a team might be a fearful thought for you with hundreds of companies providing web development services today.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Well, we can help fight out all the apprehensions and choose the right company. A little bit of research and some understanding of the different aspects of a website will give you cues to partner with the ideal company.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To help you further, we’ve summed up here some of the biggest factors that you should lookout while selecting a web development agency.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>#1 Provides customised website development</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">While many companies can provide you with web development services, very few can build your website just the way you want it. It means, they should be able to customise your website end to end with the theme, templates, and UX design that go with your branding. A customized website can leave an everlasting impact on the mind of the visitor which will persuade them to visit your site again and again.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Clearly, if you want a website that looks perfectly in line with your business concept and branding, and also want it to be fast-performing and scalable, get a company that offers customized website development services.</p>
<strong>#2 Has a planned approach for design and development</strong>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Make sure the website development company you are partnering with has an inherent process to complete the designing and development of your website. It is completely your responsibility to examine and understand the strategies and technologies that they use for turning a website idea into a vibrant reality. Besides, it will also help you know whether the company has some key methodologies for testing the website for flawless performance.</p>
<strong>#3 Looks after the matter of SEO</strong>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">No website can be considered complete until it is easily discoverable in the popular search engines like Google. It means the site is built fulfilling all the aspects of SEO. The web developers should be capable of integrating title tags, meta descriptions, different alt tags and all other on-site SEO elements required to make the website optimized for the search engines. In other words, making a site highly <a href=""https://www.uniterrene.com/search-engine-optimization/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>SEO</strong></a> optimized will help it overrun any competition and help it appear at the top of search results in Google or search engines. Eventually, it will draw more online traffic to your site, helping you to make more business.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>#4 Has an in-house team of web developers</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">You should know whether the development is done by the company’s own team of developers or they outsource the service. You should never stop asking them this because a team that is fully capable of taking care of all tasks of website development, from coding to designing to its launch and marketing is the perfect partner for developing a site.</p>
<strong>#5 Has an impressive portfolio</strong>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Make sure that the company you are considering to hire has a proven track record of completed projects. A great work portfolio reflects the depth of experience and versatility of a company. A company that boasts about their previous works is pretty confident about their knowledge of coding and technical skills. Besides, a company has worked on a vast number of projects will be well prepared to tackle any idea of website development, no matter how challenging it is.</p>
<strong>Bottom Line</strong>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">While there are so many companies that offer services of website development, the experience is the first thing that you should look for while hiring one of them. As a website development company gathers experience, they naturally become more flexible to work with the latest web development frameworks and technologies. So, they can build a website that is fast, responsive, scalable and tailored to the specific requirements of the business. Being adept with the front-running technologies of web development, they can reward you with a website that is brilliant at performance and is also capable of outshining other businesses in your industry.</p>

62,5 Ways SEO Services from a Great Agency will Help Your Business,Uniterrene,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Knowing how SEO benefits a business will amaze you.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Most of you might not think about SEO in this way but once you read this blog, you will thank us.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Using SEO services for your business website is perhaps the most assured way to get online traffic and hence, sales. Besides, many other advantages come along with that.</p>
However, before you learn about the benefits of SEO, let’s make the concept clear to you.
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“SEO or Search Engine Optimization is a tricky mechanism to work on every aspect of a website so that it becomes visible on the top of the search engine results.”</p>
The benefit? Your website gets a high amount of online traffic every day. The top search engines for which SEO works are obviously Google, Yahoo and Bing.
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If you still haven’t optimized your site for search engines, you’re losing a lot of business. So, before things get out of your hand, hire services from an <strong>SEO agency</strong> to prepare your website for the search engines.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em><strong>Here’s how their SEO services will help you.</strong></em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>People can find you easily</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">More than 3 billion searches are accounted on Google every day. Many people among them are just looking for products or services that your business offers. They are your potential customers. If your site is well optimized, then it will appear among the first few top results of Google and other search engines. So, a lot of your potential customers will end up entering your website when they see it.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>You get quality organic traffic</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">People who are searching for a product or service online, it means they really need it. Hence, online traffic can be considered as the best traffic for a business. When your website reaches on the top of the results in Google due to SEO services, it is bound to get quality traffic. As they are visitors with the urge to buy, there are most chances of them to be converted.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>It compensates for the Paid marketing</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The biggest advantage that you can get by hiring SEO services for your website is that you do not have to invest a penny on paid advertisements. Yes, you will fetch more traffic every day in your website without worrying to pay for per click. An SEO service agency will employ every strategy to make your website visible on the top of the search results. They will save the dollars on advertising which you can spend wisely in other assured marketing methods.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Your website gets promotion globally</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This one is an added advantage of SEO. Search engine optimisation will help your website reach on the top of the results in Google, the world’s giant search engine which is accessed by millions. People from every corner of the world use it to search for anything and everything. So, when your site ranks on top of Google results, people from all around the world will know about it. In other words, higher SEO ranking helps in promoting your brand or business globally in a short time.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>You can influence your customers' purchase behaviour</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The most valuable way for promoting your business is spreading good and informative content. A key part of the SEO services is about posting content and more content with relevant keywords. The keywords are selected after online research and are the most-typed words in Google. Content writers create useful content stating about the products, services, brand, or the benefits of your business incorporating them. As those content are posted on different third-party websites, people can learn about your business. Thus, more engaging your content are, the better they will be at influencing the purchase behaviour of the customers.</p>
<strong>Final Thought!</strong>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“<a href=""https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-101/what-is-seo/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">SEO is the science of getting eyeballs to the page through search. It’s a multi-discipline approach to helping web pages get found by humans and search engines</a>.” - Christine Churchill, President &amp; CEO, KeyRelevance.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">So, SEO matters in businesses because search matters! Today, we are living in the digital era where people first look for a thing online rather than on shops. So, it is important to ensure that they get your products or services found when they search for it on the web. SEO is neither an automatic mechanism and nor a one-time investment.

65,COVID-19 and India- A Land of 133.92 Crores,Uniterrene,"<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""color: #ff6600;""><strong><em>“April is the cruelest month”-T.S Eliot</em></strong></span></p>
We couldn’t agree with Eliot more. Mother earth is deeply wounded by the demon called COVID-19. Eliot wrote this famous line in his poem “The Wasteland” in the context of World War II. <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/world-52114829"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">BBC</a> has reported recently that Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary-General, has defined the outbreak of Corona as the biggest global challenge since World War II. He further warned that Corona could cause a recession “that probably has no parallel in the recent past”.

According to the statistics given by the <a href=""https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">World Health Organization</a>, worldwide 1,174,855 people have been identified as Corona affected till 6th April 2020; 64,471 people across the world have died; 209 countries, areas or territories are suffering from Corona.

Let’s have a look at the condition of some most influential countries across the globe:

The statistics have been taken from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic_by_country_and_territory"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>.

<strong>How Is India Coping with Corona?</strong>

Considering the suggestion of WHO, entire India is going through the phase of lockdown; only emergency services are available. Every day, the number of Corona affected people is climbing up. People are not getting enough food, groceries, and staples in the market while home delivery services have become entirely exhausted due to heavy demand. Patients having other health issues than Corona are not able to visit health clinics or hospitals in fear of corona. Moreover, Corona is all set to affect India’s economic growth. Multiple sectors including manufacturing, oil, financial, travel, transport, etc are suffering badly. If this is the current scenario, what future is waiting for India?

Due to the global crisis and reduced business requirements, the level of employment in multiple Indian service sectors will fall as the firms will be compelled to cut the workforce number for keeping the operating costs tight. Hence, it is clear that we are yet to witness the worse. The only way of keeping businesses alive is online marketing. Businesses should focus on website development, design, and marketing to keep their existence and reach a mass target audience. All these services can be delivered by a reputed website design company.

<strong>How can we Avoid COVID-19?</strong>

Now no vaccine is ready for preventing COVID-19. We need to avoid being exposed to this virus to prevent Corona. It can spread mainly from person-to-person. A Corona-affected person can spread it to the people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). It spreads through respiratory droplets coming out of coughs or sneezes of an infected person. These droplets tend to land in the mouths or noses of nearby people or get inhaled into the lungs. Some studies have shown that COVID-19 can be spread by people who are not showing any predictable signs.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Here On-Page SEO refers to the strategies applied to the website itself for enhancing the searchability of the website. It must highlight your best features keeping in mind the targeted keywords. Considering Off-Page SEO refers to the strategies applied for bettering search response from outside the site. However, it aims at targeted users to reach your business online. In this context, hiring a professional service provider makes the process uncomplicated.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>4. Betters User Experience</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>5. Builds Trust and Credibility</strong></p>

70,Google May 2020 Core Update: A Brief Overview,Uniterrene,"Google Search Liaison has recently introduced a broad core algorithm update. It is called “May 2020 Core Update”. What does it state? <a href=""https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/08/core-updates.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Google</strong></a> said,

“Several times a year, we make significant, broad changes to our search algorithms and systems. We refer to these as “core updates.” They’re designed to ensure that overall; we’re delivering on our mission to present relevant and authoritative content to searchers. These core updates may also affect Google Discover.

We confirm broad core updates because they typically produce some widely notable effects. Some sites may note drops or gains during them. We know those with sites that experience drops will be looking for a fix, and we want to ensure they don’t try to fix the wrong things. Moreover, there might not be anything to fix at all.”

The May Update is the first core update since the outbreak of COVID-19. Earlier, Google released core updates in 2020, January. This January Update affected some specific content verticals including:

Health
Family and Community
Beauty and Personal Care
Finance
Internet and Telecom
Vehicles
Law and Government

Websites, which fall into these categories experienced terrible SEO flux due to this update. Heath was exposed to the largest flux. Even though anecdotal, these websites may be more affected by the subsequent updates. Let’s look back at the past. The Medic update (released in 2018) also had a terrific impact on websites of YMYL (Your Money, Your Life) categories. It was designed for weeding out the sites having low authority content that could have severe impacts on someone’s wellbeing.

Now, let’s find out what the latest updates will bring to the website.

The changes from the May 2020 core updates are introduced to address the Pandemic called Coronavirus. During this pandemic, the most popular searches are related to Coronavirus. Google Search Liaison focused on the local news stories that appear with the top stories on Google Search.

What is Google Trying to Define as Local News?

“Local news can be material produced by publishers like local newspapers, that we understand specifically serve particular cities or regions. It can also be content we identify as relevant to a particular area, even if written by those outside the area.” —Google

Coronavirus has changed how individuals are looking for. This is likely why Google fused these progressions to the ""top stories"" merry go round.

Besides, Google needs to guarantee neighborhood news doesn't get covered down underneath bigger national outlets providing details regarding similar subjects.

<strong>Does the May 2020 Core Update influence search rankings?</strong>

Indeed. The underlying information shows that some bigger distributers have encountered extreme changes to certain points of arrival traffic and rankings.

We aren't sure why Google is trying outcomes on the SERP during this center update. Be that as it may, a ton of enormous distributors with elevated levels of power have encountered major motions in their rush hour gridlock and rankings.

The most probable end is that looking through practices has been changing so quickly due to Coronavirus patterns. To battle this, Google is trying a wide exhibit of indexed lists to gain from the information however much as could reasonably be expected.

However, this can demonstrate a major issue to long-lasting distributors that have endeavored to develop their traffic and site authority.

<strong>What should be done?</strong>

<strong>Update Content</strong>

One thing to note is the point at which we are ascertaining natural inquiry traffic gauges; we take a gander at the normal month to month volume of a catchphrase just as navigate rates dependent on the positioning. So occasions, for example, May 1, which is Labor Day for the vast majority of the world, didn't slant the outcomes.

Presently, to explain, we are not looking at creating new substances on a day by day or even week after week premise. They are continually refreshing their old substance.

Once more, there is no ""rubric"" on the most proficient method to refresh your old substance as it fluctuates per article, however, the key is to take the necessary steps to keep it applicable for your perusers and guarantee that it is superior to the opposition.

If you despite everything need some direction on refreshing old substance, here is what we do at Uniterrene:

If the substance is not, at this point pertinent to perusers, either erases the page and 301 divert it to the most significant URL on the site or update it to make it important.

Are there approaches to make the substance increasingly significant and valuable? For example, would including infographic, bit by bit directions, or recordings to the article make it increasingly helpful? Provided that this is true, include them.

Verify whether there are any dead connections and fix them. Dead connections make the poor client experience.

If the article is interpreted (I have a major worldwide crowd), ensure the pictures and recordings bode well to anybody perusing the substance in that language.

Would you be able to make the article less difficult? Expel cushion and abstain from utilizing complex words that not very many individuals can comprehend.

Does the article talk about a particular year or period? If conceivable, make the article evergreen by maintaining a strategic distance from the utilization of dates or explicit time ranges.

On the off chance that the article covers particular issues individuals are confronting, ensure you take a gander at Quora first before refreshing the article.

Is this article a copy? Not from a wording viewpoint, yet are you practically covering precisely the same idea as another article on your site. Provided that this is true, consider consolidating them and 301 divert one URL to the next.

<strong>Fix Thin Content</strong>

Here's another fascinating detail for you. Overall, Ubersuggest slithers 71 sites each moment. Also, when I mean slither, clients are placing in URLs to check for SEO blunders.

One mistake that our framework takes a gander at is a slender substance (pages with low-word checks).

All things considered, 46% of the sites we dissect have in any event one page that is meager in content. Would you be able to think about what number of those destinations got affected by the most recent calculation update?

We need more information on the entirety of the URLs as most of those locales to get next to no hunt traffic as they are either new destinations or haven't done much SEO.

However, when we take a gander at the last 400 destinations in our framework that were hailed with dainty substance alerts for pages other than their contact page, about page, or landing page, and had at any rate 1,000 guests every month from Google, they saw a gigantic move in rankings.

You should fix the pages that might be more inside and out. Here are the three primary inquiries to consider when fixing flimsy substance pages:

Do you truly need to include more words – on the off chance that you can get the message across in a couple of hundred words or through pictures or recordings, it might be sufficient. Try not to include words when it isn't required. Think about the client experience. Individuals would prefer to have the solution to their inquiry shortly than to hold up minutes.

How does your page contrast with the opposition – take a gander at comparable pages that are positioning on page 1. Do they have more substance than you or less? This will give you a thought on the off chance that you have to grow your page, particularly if every individual who positions on page 1 has, at any rate, a couple of thousand words on their page.

Does it at any point bode well to keep the page – on the off chance that it gives next to zero an incentive to a consumer and you can't improve it by refreshing it, you might need to consider erasing it and 301 divert the URL to another comparative page on your site.

<strong>Fix your SEO mistakes</strong>

Another fascinating finding that we saw when burrowing through our Ubersuggest information is that locales with more SEO blunders got affected extraordinarily.

Presently, this doesn't imply that if you have a huge amount of SEO blunders you can't rank or you will get hit by a calculation update.

All the more so it was one sort of blunder that hurt locales more than others. It was destinations with copy title labels and meta-tags.

One thing to note was that numerous destinations have copy meta-labels, yet when an enormous part of your pages has copy meta-labels, it, as a rule, makes issues.

So we uncovered locales that contained copy meta-labels and title labels for 20% or a greater amount of their pages.

The vast majority of these locales didn't get a lot of traffic when all is said in done, yet for the 363 that we could uncover that produced at any rate 1,000 visits every month from Google, 151 saw a diminishing in rush hour gridlock by in any event 10%.

So, this is high time you should implement the tips given above to cope with the impacts of these latest updates.",,"May 19, 2020",/assets/imgs/blog/Google-Update.jpg.jpg,Latest News,google core update|Google update,Everything you need to know about Google Latest Update,Google has recently introduced its MAY 2020 Core Updates.

71,Where is Corona Impact Taking the Indian IT Industry?,Uniterrene,"<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em>“If winter comes, can spring be far behind?”- P. B Shelley</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Perhaps, the Indian IT industry is spending every day with this hope that just like winter and spring, a promising future will come soon after the end of the pandemic called COVID-19. The flare-up of COVID-19 has brutally impacted the global economy. Businesses, across multiple sectors around the world, have already been exhausted. Let’s have a look at how pathetically the global stock market is running:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2029"" src=""https://www.uniterrene.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/111976092_optimised-1-stockimpact_24042020-nc.png"" alt="""" width=""687"" height=""552"" />IMAGE SOURCE: <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51706225"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51706225</a></p>
The outbreak of the virus has compelled maximum countries to enforce complete lockdown. As an outcome, the fear of a terrible recession is brooding over several industries including the IT industry. As the virus has affected the first-world countries mercilessly, its impact in India is comparatively lower.
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">But wait a while! It’s not a sign of relief for the Indian IT industry. Though the number of Indians affected by COVID-19 is less than in other progressive countries till now, it is not at all kind to the IT sector.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Around 55% of electronics India imports from China. Due to running lockdown, all the international flights have been suspended. It reduces the percentage from 55 to 40. It is known to all that the IT industry has been the backbone of Indian over the last few decades. It plays a remarkable role in supporting middle-class working people.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Industry experts have predicted that the COVID-19 pandemic will cause a slowdown in the growth during this financial year. In April, <a href=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/virus-attack-to-slow-down-it-growth/articleshow/74956507.cms"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Economic Times</a> reported that India’s top software exporters, Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, and HCL Technologies will be the worst victim of the reduced spending by the US and Europe-based clients.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">While this is the scenario of Indian IT giants, how small IT firms and start-ups are doing now? The answer is simple. While big ships are sinking, how can small boats survive? Small and mid-level companies are trapped in India. Most SMEs depend on outsourcing. American, European, and other foreign countries outsource IT services from small and mid-level Indian firms. These companies offer several IT services including affordable websites, mobile app, and other kinds of software development services.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Since the economy of the first-world countries is standing on the verge of collapse, gaining new projects is nothing but a dream for Indian IT firms. Moreover, the running projects may come to a close; payments may become uncertain. In such circumstances, most companies will be unable to provide salaries to their employees. As an outcome, a huge employee laid off is breathing down our neck.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Indian IT firms will find even a more terrific challenge when the companies will renegotiate the existing contracts and try to grapple growth initiatives and discretionary. In recent days, several Indian firms have faced multiple project cancellations by their clients due to the bindings in air travel and shutting down of cities and countries for breaking the chain of Coronavirus.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A <a href=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/covid-19-to-hurt-it-services-sector-growth-may-fall-to-3-5-in-fy21-icra/articleshow/75069492.cms?from=mdr"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">report</a> has revealed, ""Though management of IT companies has restrained to quantify the potential impact of the COVID-19 breakout on the financials, there has been a disruption in service delivery and execution due to travel restrictions, client's confidentiality clauses, and work-from-home (WFH) advisories since mid-March”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">From the above discussion, the current state of the Indian IT industry is lucid. Still, we should not forget Shelley’s optimistic line, “if winter comes, can spring be far behind?” Everything is destined to have an ending. One day, the mother Earth will come out of the grip of the virus. The human race will again get the flow of living back. Gradually, the economy will also regain its previous stature. When the economy will regain its strength, the IT industry will get oxygen once again.</p>

91,Top 8 Factors Affecting the On-page SEO of Your Website,Uniterrene,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Having a successful SEO strategy is of paramount importance for businesses nowadays. With every other competitor trying their best to score the top rank in the search engines, you would certainly lag behind in the race if you haven’t invested in developing an effective SEO campaign yet. Hiring <a href=""https://www.uniterrene.com/search-engine-optimization/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>affordable SEO services in India</strong></a> is hence, the next big thing to do for you to optimize your website in the best possible way.</p>
While considering the process of developing an SEO strategy, you need to focus on both On-page SEO and Off-page SEO. On-page SEO focusses on the practices or techniques of optimizing the pages of your website to increase the amount of organic website traffic by improving search engine rankings. On the contrary, Off-page SEO relates to all the techniques that are being implemented outside your website for building internal links and improving the site’s trustworthiness and authority. In this web blog, we would emphasize on the vital factors that you must consider while creating a strategy for On-page optimization.
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Title tags</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Though it might have a nominal impact on the organic ranking of your site as visitors mostly search by using keywords in the search engines, the title tag offers a primary clue of the topic being searched. Hence, issues related to duplicate or missing title tags might impact the SEO results of your website adversely.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Meta descriptions</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Meta tags are used for offering the page’s description on what it is all about. They help in improving the quality of your SEO results, and ratings as well.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Links</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There are three types of links which, you need to consider for On-page SEO. These are as follows:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>• Inbound links:</strong> The search engines make use of inbound links for determining how much relevant and authoritative the content of your website is.</p>
<strong>• Outbound links:</strong> Outbound links are being used for showing that you’ve been developing quality content for users.
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>• Internal links:</strong> By linking your own contents, you can tie the web pages for both the visitors and search engines thereby, increasing the value of your pages.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Page loading speed</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Another important On-page SEO factor is the loading speed of your web pages. As search engines mostly focus on delivering an improved user experience to users, they will always prefer sites that has a faster loading speed.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Header tag</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">These are mainly used for identifying the heading of your content and indirectly affect the search engine rankings as well by mentioning the relevant keywords.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Mobile friendliness</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">With smartphones and other mobile devices becoming the primary source of surfing Internet, it has become important for you to ensure that your users can browse through the web pages of your site on their phones and tablets. Mobile friendliness specifies on how a particular website appears and functions when it is being opened on the mobile. So, you need to ensure that your site is mobile-friendly and make use of open design which, can adjust the content as per the device. Hence, if your website isn’t being mobile-friendly yet, it might affect your SEO rankings negatively.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Content optimization</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This method focusses on developing most useful content that can reach the maximum number of audience. In the process of optimizing content, you need to ensure that all the associated keywords are being included. As experts suggest, it is always better to assign a specific keyword to each of the pages for optimizing the contents at their best.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness and Trustworthiness)</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Last but not the least, you must focus on the systematic framework introduced by Google that helps in assessing the web pages, contents, and websites in an overall basis.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>• E for Expertise:</strong> This concerns to check whether author of a specific part of the content is having adequate knowledge and skills in the specific field.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>• A for Authority:</strong> This refers to check whether the site or web page is the right source to answer the search question.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>• T for Trustworthiness:</strong> This checks whether the author delivers an authentic presentation on the subject relevant to their content.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>The bottom line</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">All these above-mentioned factors are certainly to be focussed on for developing a result-driven on-page SEO strategy. However, professional help of experts is always recommended as analysing all these aspects with limited knowledge and expertise won’t be the right thing to do. Hence, look for professional and affordable SEO services in India to craft a business-specific and highly effective on-page SEO strategy.</p>

You should always add share buttons to the contents being posted to make it easily reachable to your target audience and allow common people to share your contents too.

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">#6. Try to target for featured snippets of Google</h4>

Following here are a few effective tips and tricks to create content that can be shown as a featured snippet by Google.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As it has become more important than ever to develop and maintain a website for your business, you must draw some of your attention towards web designing and development. Though both of them are often used interchangeably, both the concepts are quite different from each other. And to help you on the same, we are here to discuss on what is difference between web design and web development. Let’s get started!</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">Website designing</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a href=""https://www.uniterrene.com/web-design/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Web designing</strong></a> can be defined as the process of designing, conceptualizing, and organizing the content which you are intending to upload online for your business. Though it was primarily involved with the way your website appears, nowadays it is considered to be much beyond of that while focussing on content marketing and management as well. Following here is a list of the key elements of website designing, which basically determine how the website will look like.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Visual elements include:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Typography
• Written copy
• Colours
• Fonts
• Layout
• Spacing
• Shapes
• Icons
• Image
• Videos
• Mock-ups</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">On the contrary, the functional elements include:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Speed
• Navigation
• Site structure
• User interaction
• Animation</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The ultimate objective of website designers is to design a site that appears to be great. With detailed understanding on the user-friendliness and web usability, they try to promote user interactivity by designing a stunning website layout.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">Website development</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When it comes to <a href=""https://www.uniterrene.com/web-development/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>web development</strong></a>, you need to mainly focus on both front-end development and back-end development. Though a web developer, typically known as full-stack developer is expected to have relevant skills to work on these both these areas, it is always important for you as the client to hire a specialist. Though front-end development mainly takes visual design or appearance of the website into consideration by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, back-end development mainly involves advanced programming and interactions by mostly working on codes and deploying different technologies including PHP, software tools, and other CMS platforms. Some of the other popular frameworks being used for web development are Angular, Laravel, Vue, React, CodeIgniter, and much more. There are basically seven types of web development, which include:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Static web development
• Dynamic CMS development

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">Key areas of differences in between web designing and development</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Though both web designers and web developers share the same kind of skills, they are certainly about to have relevant competencies in their own areas. As website designing typically emphasises on the aesthetics, designers are likely to have a higher level of knowledge on the aspects that make a website look appealing, interactive, and logical for the users. They must be proficient enough with the various design applications including JavaScript, Adobe Dreamweaver, and other scripting frameworks used for different front-end applications. Moreover, they need to ensure that the design layout they create fits the brand, colour schemes, and logos of the business perfectly.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">On the contrary, web developers are the ones responsible for building your website’s functional aspects while considering all the aesthetic parameters being mentioned by the web designers. With progressive programming skills, they try to give life to the product being envisioned by web designers. They also need to have a strong grip over the various software languages including Python, Structured Query Language (SQL), machine learning, Java server development, database tools and server architecture, development of APIs to interact with objects, and agile system analysis.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Now that you have gained a clear overview on both the concepts including the areas of differences, let us help you get a closer look on some of the intrinsic factors you should always consider while designing and developing a website. The top 5 strategic factors to look for are:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• <strong>Visual</strong>: When it comes to the visual of your website, you need to focus on its look and feel which includes various details such as general layout, fonts, images, and texts. The primary goal of on-screen visuals is making the website attractive for users while making them engaged to it.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• <strong>Content</strong>: Needless to say; that content is always the king. When it comes to promoting your brand, content provides you the scope to deliver the right information people were being searching for and learn more about the business.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• <strong>Navigation</strong>: This is another essential factor, which you must take into consideration that helps you connect with the relevant and deliver an ultimate one-of-a-kind user experience to your visitors. This in turn, allows people to explore and interact more with your website.</p>
• <strong>User-friendliness</strong>: Website usability or user friendliness focusses on embracing accessibility of the information throughout all the web pages of the site. Testing the entire website iteratively is considered to be the best way to optimise the website’s usability as recommended by experts.
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• <strong>Intuitiveness</strong>: Offering a natural flow to your website visitors while browsing through your website is the main objective of creating an intuitive design. It allows users to pass through a chain of interactions smoothly without facing any disturbance or confusion en route.</p>
<strong>The bottom line</strong>

<h5 style=""text-align: justify;"">Pay-Per-Click (PPC) Advertising: A brief</h5>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPC"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>PPC or Pay-Per-Click</strong></a> Advertising can be defined as a model of advertising that helps businesses or marketers to post ads on different online advertising platforms. Every time the ad gets clicked they need to pay a certain amount of fees to the host platform. Two of the most popular search engines for PPC advertising are Google and Bing and when it comes to the ideal social media platforms for PPC, you should consider Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and more.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The main objective of PPC ads is to drive the audience to click and visit the website or app of the advertiser and file the contact form or make the final purchase. Hence, marketers always try to make the ad copy interesting, connecting, and conversion-driven. By hiring a PPC expert for your campaign, you can stay assured of achieving considerable results for your business.</p>

<h5 style=""text-align: justify;"">Following here are the potential ways by which PPC can benefit your business.</h5>
<h5 style=""text-align: justify;"">Deriving immediate outcomes</h5>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Unlike SEO or other organic online marketing practices, PPC offers you immediate results which, means you can experience steady traffic and conversions in no time. Around one-third of the total online customers across the globe use Internet to get information on various types of products and services on daily basis. This brings a large pool of potential audience for you, especially if your ad is being displayed properly at the top of significant online search results. Hence, it is always the most ideal option if you are looking for a way to fulfil your short-term goals.</p>

<h5 style=""text-align: justify;"">Measuring the campaign’s performance</h5>

<h5 style=""text-align: justify;"">Connecting with the potential audience</h5>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">PPC allows you to have full-fledged control over the target audience or visitors of your ads. While running a PPC campaign, you would be able to choose the users of certain age groups, locations, time zones, gender, interests, and more. Hence, you would be able to target customers based on your product or service offerings, ensuring that you reach to the right audience in an effective way. Hence, it basically offers you the flexibility to deliver the ads to the users as per your wish or goals.</p>

<h5 style=""text-align: justify;"">Not impacted by the Google or SEO algorithmic changes</h5>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When it comes to organic traffic, it becomes important for marketers to focus on the Google algorithm changes. Your website’s online visibility and search engine results drastically get impacted by the Google and SEO algorithm changes. But the same doesn’t happen in case of PPC. And hence, you can stay assured that no matter how many times the Google algorithm changes, the results or performance of your <a href=""https://www.uniterrene.com/pay-per-click/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>PPC campaign</strong></a> is not going to get affected by the same.</p>

<h5 style=""text-align: justify;"">A brief on the history of Instagram</h5>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Alike Facebook, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Instagram</strong></a> was also launched as a social media app, which basically worked as a combination of 2 words ‘Instant Camera’ and ‘Telegram’. It was developed by Mike Krieger and Kevin Systrom in October 2010 but later in the year 2012, it was bought by Mark Zuckerberg at a work of $1 billion. Instagram is mainly used by people for different purposes like:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• Sharing and editing images
• Connecting with people
• Doing online business
• Influencer marketing, and more.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">While planning the social media strategy, many of us often get confused on which particular platform will prove to be more lucrative in promoting our business. And this is why it is important for you to understand both the similarities and differences in between these two social media channels for developing a well-balanced strategy. So, before we dive further into finding out which one is better among the two, let’s consider some of the similarities between them.</p>

<h5 style=""text-align: justify;"">Points of similarities in between Facebook and Instagram</h5>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Though the target audience or purpose of both the apps are a bit different, there are some prominent similarities to consider which, are being discussed here as under.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• <strong>Like, comment and share:</strong> Instagram and Facebook, both support the feature of like, comment, and share, which, helps us to stay connected with our friends.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• <strong>Follow people:</strong> Next, both of them allows you to follow or add your friends, family members, and unknown people as well.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• <strong>Block people:</strong> Both these platforms allow users to block people with whom they aren’t willing to keep any further connection or communication.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Now that you’re aware of how Facebook and Instagram are similar to each other, let’s move further to understand a comparative overview on Instagram vs Facebook which is better.</p>

<h5 style=""text-align: justify;"">How Facebook holds an advantage over Instagram</h5>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">With the highest brand engagement, Facebook is considered to be the 3rd most visited website across the world, following <strong><a href=""https://www.google.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Google</a> </strong>and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>YouTube</strong></a>. One thing that makes it extremely special is it attracts all the age groups of Internet users (adults). The age group that’s the most participating on Facebook is of 18-29 as it’s being noticed that around 82% of the total Facebook users come from this age group. Due to such incredible acceptance, it delivers the scope of increased ad visibility to the businesses who are willing to promote their brands via Facebook. Also, if you’re planning to incorporate posts for promoting your products and services, blogs, or landing pages, it will offer quite an interactive atmosphere, where you can even include direct links with the posts.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">On the contrary, Instagram users can include only one link in their bio and without any link on the image being posted. Hence, Facebook surely gets an upper hand in this case. However, you can’t always expect that more visibility means more conversions as the message needs to be interactive at the end of the day, irrespective of the platform.</p>

<h5 style=""text-align: justify;"">How Instagram holds an advantage over Facebook</h5>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Instagram is considered to be the ideal platform for connecting with a younger age group of audience as its user base includes a substantial proportion of millennial following. Being more visual compared to Facebook, it holds the interest of users who are more interested in photography, fashion, travel, architecture, beauty, among some of them. This young potential audience has been noticed to spend a significant amount of their time while doing product research in the app and showing interest on several brands. It’s being revealed that more than 1/3 of the total users of Instagram have purchased online by using their mobile phones and they spend around 15.4% time more than on Facebook daily on an average basis. What makes it more appealing is; around 72% of marketers are presently harnessing its potential. Some of the latest attributes such as reels, product tags, shoppable feeds, guides, badges, and more have made this platform more market-friendly indeed. Hence, when it comes to majorly targeting the young audience, Instagram is slightly ahead of Facebook to help you derive better results.</p>

<h5 style=""text-align: justify;"">The bottom line</h5>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Social media and online shopping have certainly revolutionized the way we do business. And always remember that to develop a winning social media strategy, you not only need to set your objectives right but also choose the right social media platforms that can help you fulfil them right. In contrary to the same, the topic Instagram vs Facebook which is better, has always been a matter of discussion among the marketers and business fraternity. With the above-mentioned points of similarities and differences pointed out, we believe it would be much more easier for you to make the right call and develop a ground-breaking social media strategy for your business.</p>

105,Explore the Difference between Traditional Marketing and Digital Marketing,Uniterrene,"<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Marketing</strong></a> has always been an integral element of a business’s success strategy. No matter whether you manufacture a specific product or deliver a particular service, you need to promote the same so that your customers are aware of your offering and reach up to you for their relevant needs.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The world of marketing has undergone a massive paradigm shift within the past few decades from the concept of traditional marketing to the innovative digital marketing.

This in turn, has make things much more convenient and easy for marketers. Here in this blog, let’s find out the difference between traditional marketing and digital marketing so that you can stay well-informed while developing a tailored marketing strategy for your business.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Traditional marketing – A brief</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Being the conventional practice, it can be defined as the marketing and promotion of products and services by using offline communication channels including TV ads, newspaper, radio ads, magazines, posters and flyers, billboards, telemarketing, SMS marketing, direct mailers, and etc. To make it more simple, any marketing channel which, don’t need the Internet, will be considered under traditional marketing.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As revealed by the BARC, India has a total of 892 million television viewers, which sums up almost 66% of its total population and the average time being spent by each of the viewers is around 4 hours/day on TV.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>• Mass outreach</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Traditional marketing allows marketers to connect with a wide spectrum of audience with the help of popular communication channels such as newspapers, TV, radio, and more. This marketing practice is the ideal one for the locations where the Internet is not much popular or available.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>• Long-lasting impression</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Traditional marketing practices allow you to connect and be with the target audience for longer time via the use of popular channels including TV, newspaper ads, direct mailers, SMS, magazine ads, and more. Hence, they are considered as long-lasting and come with a better shelf life.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>• Easy to understand</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As the concept of traditional marketing is quite common and has been into practice for the longer time, people find it much easier to work with these marketing practices. Research has also shown us that traditional marketing practices require less cognitive power to develop, implement, and monitor compared to digital advertising practices.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Digital marketing – A brief</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Being considered as the future of marketing, it can be defined as the marketing and promotion of products and services by using different online communication channels including <a href=""https://www.uniterrene.com/search-engine-optimization/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</strong></a>, Search Engine Marketing (SEM), email, display ads, <a href=""https://www.uniterrene.com/social-media-marketing/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Social Media Marketing (SMM)</strong></a>, websites, and affiliate marketing. So basically any marketing channel which makes use of the Internet comes under digital marketing.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As revealed by the TRAI, the total number of Internet users in India as of March 2021 is 825 million, which accounts for around 61% of the total population. Also the average time being spent by each of the users on Internet is 3.4 hours/day as recorded by Ericsson Consumer Lab.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>• Enhanced customer interaction</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As it facilitates two-way interaction with customers, it will allow you to foster higher customer engagement in between the brands and customers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>• Cost-effectiveness</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Compared to traditional marketing practices, it is less expensive and doesn’t need any hefty budget. You can always implement digital marketing campaigns with a small budget and then after, you can scale up based on the outcomes.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>• Accurate targeting</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Digital marketing allows you to target your audience more accurately, which, in turn ensures that there is reduced spillover thereby, making it more convenient and cost-effective.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>• Easy tracking</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Unlike traditional marketing, this practice allows you track the response of target audience and measure the same at each and every step.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">What are the differences between traditional marketing and digital marketing</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Now that you’ve gained a fair idea of both the practices and their respective benefits, let’s dig deep further to find out the difference between traditional marketing and digital marketing.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Customer interaction</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Traditional marketing facilitates one-way communication, which means the targeted customers won’t be able to communicate back or interact with your business. However, digital marketing facilitates two-way communication where your target audience can respond to you by accessing any of the digital channels.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Marketing channels</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">One of the fundamental differences in between these marketing practices is the channels being used for them. While traditional marketing makes use of offline communication channels like Print, TV, billboard, and others, digital marketing helps you to use online communication channels such as email, website, social media, search engine marketing, and more.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Expenses</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Traditional marketing is scale-driven and an expensive option, and thus not considered to be ideal for longer time durations. On the contrary, digital marketing is known to be less expensive than the conventional practice and thus, can operate at lower scale.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>ROI measurement and tracking</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It is undoubtedly challenging to estimate the Return on Investment (ROI) in case of traditional marketing practices, as it becomes quite difficult to establish a direct and accurate correlation in between sales and marketing. On the other hand, digital marketing helps you estimate the ROI for each of the channels in terms of leads, clicks, conversion to sales all of which are easy to measure and track the performances.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Innovative changes</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In traditional marketing, you won’t find much scope to modify or change the creative, after it is being released. However, in digital marketing, the nature of medium allows you to change or modify the ad creative easily, while considering the target audience’s response.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Targeting accuracy</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The audience targeting is considered to be at a broader level with scope for lesser accuracy in traditional marketing whereas, in digital marketing, the audience targeting is much more narrow and accurate, which will further increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the campaigns.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Tailored communication</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The ad’s creative and communication are considered to be the standards and equal for the whole target audience in case of traditional marketing. However, in digital marketing, you will get the scope to personalize or customize the ad’s creative and communication as per the narrow segment of target audience.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Speed of response</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In case of traditional marketing, the response achieved from target audience generally has a time lag, as the medium of communication doesn’t facilitate any quick response. However, the digital medium of communication offers to get instant responses from the target customers in form of leads, clicks, sales, and more.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>The bottom line</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">With such extensive information on the difference between traditional marketing and digital marketing, things are certainly going to get clearer and more understandable for the marketers. To ensure your marketing message is being communicated to the right audience in the right way, you need to develop a tailored strategy combining both the practices and ensure that your brand enjoys maximum visibility across the traditional and digital marketing channels. To help you on the same, experienced marketing analysts can be of great help for you indeed who will not only focus on preparing the right channel mix for your campaign but, also ensure that all your objectives are met successfully.</p>

But, developing just a basic website without anything unique or value-delivering for the users won’t be any good for a business as the competition is extremely fierce when we talk about <a href=""https://www.uniterrene.com/digital-marketing/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>online marketing</strong></a>. As revealed in the Web Server Survey of Netcraft in October 2021, there were a total of 1,179, 448,021 websites worldwide. So, you can understand that how much important it is for an entrepreneur to develop a high-performing and ROI-driven website for ensuring a continuous flow of user traffic.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Website without a substantial amount of user traffic doesn’t have any value, isn’t it! And considering the very same, what we all should focus on is to find out how to improve your website performance. To help you in this journey, this blog is here with everything discussed.</p>

<h5 style=""text-align: justify;"">Optimize the images</h5>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To get started, you should focus on optimizing the images of your website. Trusted SEO experts can guide you about the different ways of optimizing them. You should also try to reduce the sizes to ensure that they aren’t affected the loading speed of website adversely. Some of the ways of image optimization are:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• <strong>Considering the SVG icons:</strong> Instead of using the PNG icons, you can always choose SVG icons as they are smaller in size and look good irrespective of the screen’s size. This means you don’t require any multiple icon sizes for different types of resolutions.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• <strong>Compressing the image files:</strong> You should also use different tools for reducing the file size of GIF, JPEG, and PNG images.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• <strong>Using the right dimensions:</strong> You should also try to save the images in the right dimension which, is being used on the website instead of depending on CSS or HTML for resizing them. This in turn, will help you to minimize the total image size, thereby improving the page’s loading time.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• <strong>Saving images in right format:</strong> Another tip which, you should consider is to save the images in the correct format. For instance, if you want an image to portray a photographic scene, then you should choose the JPEG format whereas, you should use the PNG format if looking for transparency.</p>

<h5 style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Minify all the JavaScript and CSS documents</strong></h5>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Minification is basically the process of removing all unneeded characters like source code comments, tabs, and spaces from source code for minimizing the file size. JavaScript and CSS files mostly contain white spaces, line breaks, and page breaks for making the codes more readable. But, this kind of formatting mostly increases the files’ sizes, thereby impacting the website’s performance adversely. By using a tool like Minify, you would be able to remove such line breaks and white spaces, thereby making these files much smaller.</p>

<h5 style=""text-align: justify;"">Minimize the HTTP requests</h5>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For all the JavaScript and CSS files and other images on the website, the user’s browser needs to make an HTTPS or HTTO request on your website’s server. A number of similar requests add up to the website’s loading time, which delivers a not-so-satisfactory performance to visitors. This is why you should always try to minimize the total number of HTTP requests and following here are a few tips you must consider.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• <strong>Using CSS rather than images:</strong> Instead of using the images for dividers, horizontal lines, and backgrounds, consider using the CSS as it will help you in improving the website’s performance without compelling the users to wait for loading the images.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">• <strong>Combining multiple JavaScript and CSS files:</strong> You should create one master file for all the JavaScript files and one for the CSS files. Then you must copy each of the JavaScript and CSS files separately into their respective master files.</p>

<h5 style=""text-align: justify;"">Enable the Gzip compression</h5>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Another potential way of improving the website’s performance which you must consider is enabling the Gzip compression of your server. This will actually help you in compressing the CSS and HTML files on website before they were being sent to browser. Generally, the browser always checks whether the Gzip compression is being enabled or not and if it is done, then the visitor’s browser downloads the Gzip file instead of requesting to download the original CSS and HTML files.</p>

<h5 style=""text-align: justify;"">Deploy a CDN</h5>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">CDN or Content Delivery Network refers to the distributed computer network which, primarily delivers all the static files like CSS, JavaScript, and HTML and different types of video files and images on the basis of geographic locations. So, basically using a CDN helps you to load from the closest server to your visitors who are browsing your website.</p>

<h5 style=""text-align: justify;"">Disable the query strings for all your static resources</h5>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Query strings refer to the suffixes being used at end of the URLs, which mainly start with special characters like ampersands and question marks. Their primary goal is to help you in identifying the specific versions of assets and get to know about the caching restrictions. Using the query strings will help you to identify the cache and compel the browser to load the file’s latest version.</p>

<h5 style=""text-align: justify;"">Fix the broken URLs</h5>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Broken URLs can certainly be the reason of your website’s poor performance. Having a lot of broken URLs on the website might create problems, thereby preventing the search engine bots to index other critical web pages and affecting your customer base in long run. These URLs can even create impression that the website isn’t functioning properly, which in turn would drive away your visitors, thereby resulting in an increased bounce rate. Keeping this into consideration, you should try to crawl the website on regular intervals and check whether all the URLs are working properly.</p>

<h5 style=""text-align: justify;"">Upgrade your hosting plan</h5>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If your website has increased in size and it has been receiving a substantial amount of web traffic, then it’s time for you to upgrade the hosting plan. By switching to a managed hosting plan or VPS, you will be able to have increased control over your server’s resources because of VPS access or hosting to website maintenance and optimized server configuration for holistic support.</p>

<h5 style=""text-align: justify;"">The bottom line</h5>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Once all these changes have been implemented successful, you must try to test or evaluate the website’s performance and figure out the improvement in its loading speed. Also, you should rely on an experienced web developer who can not only guide you on how to improve your website performance and also further help you to test the efficacy of implementing suggested changes as well. This in turn, will help you in ensuring seamless functioning and performance of your website.</p>

112,How Much Does SEO Cost In Australia? Read To Know!,Uniterrene,"Do you feel like your SEO service provider is overcharging you? Or perhaps, you are just entering the world of SEO and <a href=""https://www.uniterrene.com/digital-marketing/""><strong>digital marketing</strong></a>. Regardless of your circumstances, if you are eager to learn about SEO costs in Australia, this blog is for you!

SEO cost per month in Australia varies dramatically based on a number of factors, like market trends, individual SEO providers, the spectrum of services you receive, deliverables and others. Hence, getting a specific number without speaking to an SEO specialist can be challenging.

However, there are ways to estimate how much you may spend on the services.

So, dive into the following section as we discuss the average cost of SEO packages.
<h2><strong>SEO Cost In Australia: Is It As Expensive As You Think?</strong></h2>
A one-time SEO job can approximately cost $3,500 – $10,000+ in Australia, based on the number of pages you need to optimise and target keywords.
<h3><strong>How much should you spend on SEO services in Australia?</strong></h3>
As mentioned before, there’s no specific number to judge the suitability of SEO services. While some businesses invest less than $1,500 monthly for result-driven services, others spend significantly more yet receive significant benefits.
<ul>
 	<li>The type of business you operate</li>
 	<li>The competition in your industry</li>
 	<li>The size of your targeted market and customer segmentation</li>
 	<li>The location of your services or businesses</li>
 	<li>Previous SEO work</li>
 	<li>The amount of new SEO services and content you require</li>
 	<li>The number of pages your website needs</li>
</ul>
Your SEO agency’s pricing can also vary based on a few factors, such as their credentials, service quality, experience and existing client base.
<h3><strong>Estimating the average cost of SEO in Australia:</strong></h3>
The average SEO cost in Australia can be anywhere between $1,400 and $10,000+ per month. The price primarily depends on the specific SEO services you require. Most SEO services come with ongoing support, regular maintenance services, content updates, link building, content marketing and more.

There are different <strong><a href=""https://www.uniterrene.com/search-engine-optimization/"">SEO packages available in Australia</a></strong>, such as the foundational package that includes website setup, on-page, technical SEO and content.

To give you a rough idea, the basic search engine optimisation cost per month in Australia can be approximately $1,400 -$2,500 for small businesses, $1,600 – $7,500 for medium companies, $2,500 per month – $10,000+ for large businesses and $7,500+ for enterprises.
<h3><strong>SEO cost in Australia per hour:</strong></h3>
Most SEO companies prefer charging by their deliverables or on a monthly basis. But the ones that charge by the hour often bill their clients $100 – $180, depending on the extensivity of the services.

Regardless of the cost, it’s essential to remember that <strong><a href=""https://www.uniterrene.com/incredible-tips-on-how-to-appear-in-google-search-engine-results/"">SEO strategies</a></strong> take time to deliver visible results. Therefore, it’s wise to choose a service provider that offers monthly packages or charges based on their service quality.
<h3><strong>Should you pay per keyword?</strong></h3>
Charging based on keywords is an outdated method. Naturally, experts don’t recommend investing in such services. It opens up a lot of room for mistakes and fraud. Furthermore, keywords change constantly. Hence, it’s certainly not an ideal long-term SEO strategy.
<h3><strong>Is keeping in-house SEO professionals cheaper?</strong></h3>
In Australia, <a href=""https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo"">SEO specialists</a> earn between $60,000 and $190,000 yearly, based on their experience and expertise. While keeping an in-house team of SEO experts may seem beneficial, it will be more expensive in the long term. Plus, a single SEO professional cannot handle the workload of an entire agency. Hence, you must create a team with skills like keyword research, website audit, competitor research, copywriting, technical SEO implementations, link building, off-site SEO strategy and SEO reporting.
<h3><strong>Endnote</strong></h3>
Hopefully, the above numbers gave you an idea about how much you may need to spend on your SEO requirement. However, remember that the SEO cost in Australia mentioned above is only estimation. The numbers can drastically vary based on services, locations and goals. If you want more specific information on SEO cost, search for an SEO cost calculator tool in Australia or speak with a professional agency.",,"May 24, 2023",/assets/imgs/blog/How-Much-Does-SEO-Cost-In-Australia-Read-To-Know.jpg,SEO Services,,Estimating The Average Cost Of SEO In Australia,Discover the average SEO cost in Australia.

<h2>Key Australian SEO Trends You Should Be Aware Of!</h2>
Creating a mobile-friendly, SEO-optimised and fast-loading website with interactive design is only the first step towards building a captivating digital presence. Once your website is up and running, you must constantly invest in <a href=""https://www.uniterrene.com/why-organic-seo-service-is-a-must-for-wining-business-success/""><strong>SEO strategies</strong></a> and polish it according to the evolving marketing criteria to stay relevant.

Here’re the trendiest SEO strategies you must follow to maintain your website’s ranking on the SERP page.
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Focusing On Link Building</strong></li>
</ol>
The days of spamming links over random directories are long gone. Now link building is more about where your links come from than how many links you have. Low-quality links can negatively affect your SERP rankings, while relevant links from highly authoritative sites can improve the rankings.
<ol start=""2"">
 	<li><strong>Quality Content Is Still The King</strong></li>
</ol>
Search engines don't want businesses to write content to impress robots and crawlers. Instead, they want websites to create high-quality content that answers the search queries of internet users. With semantic search and Google updates, search engineers look for valuable insights, long-form content, and how-to guides with in-depth information.
<ol start=""3"">
 	<li><strong>Taking Advantage Of Predictive Search</strong></li>
</ol>
One of the best Australian SEO trends in 2023 is leveraging predictive search. It refers to Google’s autofill features as well as discover feed. Google Discover has grown significantly, with over 800 million since its release. And it has shown excellent potential to bring visitors to websites through content.
<ol start=""4"">
 	<li><strong>Ranking No. 1 Is Not As Important As It Used To Be</strong></li>
</ol>
It may sound absurd, but the significance of ranking in the first position of search engine result pages has reduced drastically with the rise of paid advertising.

Businesses are shifting their focus towards <a href=""https://www.uniterrene.com/the-top-5-latest-keyword-research-tools-of-2017/""><strong>long-tail keywords</strong></a> and local SEO. Long-tail keywords generally have less traffic than usual keywords. Plus, these keywords are more specific, so you will get more consumers relevant to your business.
<ol start=""5"">
 	<li><strong>Featuring Snippets</strong></li>

115,ChatGPT Vs Google Bard: How They Stack Up Against Each Other,Uniterrene,"Everyone has witnessed the hype around AI in recent years. And frequently, Google has been at the forefront of this hype. However, things changed when OpenAI stole the spotlight with ChatGPT. To counter the popularity of ChatGPT and regain its dominance, Google launched BARD in March 2023, fueling the topic of ChatGPT vs Google BARD.

Since the launch of BARD, many experts have named it the superior AI chatbot, while others suggested that ChatGPT still has the upper hand.

So, which one should you use?

To bring some clarity to this argument, we present to you a comprehensive comparison between ChatGPT and <a href=""https://bard.google.com/""><strong>Google BARD</strong></a>.

Let’s dive in!
<h2><strong>ChatGPT Vs Google Bard: A Comprehensive Comparison</strong></h2>
Essentially, both ChatGPT and Google BARD use natural language processing to generate human-like responses.

However, both of these AI language models have some key differences, including the ones below:
<ol>
 	<li>
<h4><strong> What Powers Them?
</strong></h4>
Google BARD AI utilises Google's Language Model LaMDA for Dialogue Applications. It offers responses based on real-time, current research pulled from scarring the internet.

On the flip side, ChatGPT uses its own Generative Pre-training Transformer to answer your questions. While ChatGPT predecessors got their training from an array of text sourced from the internet, like articles and books, BARD uses training from Infiniset. Infiniset scours the web to generate real-time, relevant and up-to-date answers.

The problem with ChatGPT is that its sources end in 2021, limiting its knowledge about current events.</li>
 	<li>
<h4><strong>BARD Vs. ChatGPT 4: Pricing
</strong></h4>
ChatGPT has free and paid versions, while BARD is free to whoever can access it. The paid versions of ChatGPT offer access to the AI language models during peak hours, faster replies, priority access and other features.</li>
 	<li>
<h4><strong>GPT Is For Text Functions, LaMDA Is For Dialogue
</strong></h4>
To understand ChatGPT vs Google BARD, it’s essential to comprehend their core structure. The transformer architecture used to build the chatbots is the same but different. <a href=""https://openai.com/""><strong>OpenAI</strong></a> designed GPT-3 and GPT-4 to understand and generate texts for multiple purposes. LaMDA, which fuels Google BARD, has a unique design that enables it to have more open-ended and natural conversations.

LaMDA tries to grasp the undertone or intent behind the user’s question and the context nuances. As a result, its answers are more human-like and ultra-authentic. It even claims to have feelings.

On the other hand, ChatGPT’s answers can be more robotic and generic. It’s more capable of summarising texts, powering other AI tools like <a href=""https://www.copy.ai/""><strong>Copy.ai</strong></a> or <a href=""https://www.jasper.ai""><strong>Jasper</strong></a>, completing natural language tasks, generating texts based on statistics and translating texts.</li>
 	<li>
<h4><strong>ChatGPT Can Write a Large Amount of Text, But BARD Can Draw From The Web
</strong></h4>
Due to its ability to pull information in real-time, BARD can answer all your questions. It gives BARD an upper hand over ChatGPT’s general knowledge limited to 2021.

So, you can use Google BARD to get more accurate, up-to-date data regarding research and current events. However, BARD obtains its information from anything and everything from the web, including Wikipedia. Hence, it can be inaccurate at times.

Alternatively, ChatGPT is ideal for writing and generating blog ideas and emails. Yet, it also has limitations. The content generated by ChatGPT can often be vague.</li>
 	<li>
<h4><strong>User Experience: Google BARD Vs ChatGPT
</strong></h4>
Next on ChatGPT vs Google BARD is user experience.

Both conversational AIs are straightforward to use. However, Google BARD gets more points here. It offers voice prompts that you can use via your microphone. There’s also a<em> <strong>“Google it”</strong></em> button to take your research beyond BARD. Furthermore, it generates and displays multiple responses side-by-side for comparison.

In comparison, ChatGPT is more straightforward and requires users to put more effort into checking all the responses.</li>
 	<li>
<h4><strong>BARD Will Enhance The Use Of Google Search, ChatGPT Will Partner With Bing
</strong></h4>
There’s no doubt that Google BARD has an incredible ability to synthesise data into an easy-to-understand format. And it will eventually change how people search for information or use search engines. There’s also a possibility that Google will integrate BARD into Google Search.

On the other hand, Microsoft has already integrated parts of OpenAI's tweaked GPT-4 into Bing. However, it still needs a lot of polishing.
<h4><strong> </strong></h4>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>ChatGPT Vs Google Bard: Which One's Better?</strong></h3>
While it's easy to pitch these two against each other, it’s essential to remember that experts designed them to be different. ChatGPT is ideal for text functions and coding, while Google BARD is perfect for research.

Google BARD can draw information from the internet and give real-time answers, while ChatGPT can dramatically improve your content marketing. You can rely on BARD for information on current events and ChatGPT for more detailed data on topics.
<h3><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></h3>
<strong>ChatGPT vs Google BARD</strong>: which one do you prefer? Hopefully, the above points have given you some idea of the differences between these two chatbots. It’s essential to note that both of these tools have a long way to go. Hence, it’s best to leave it on time to prove which is better.",,"June 06, 2023",/assets/imgs/blog/ChatGPT-Vs-Google-Bard.jpg,AI,,The Facts to Learn About ChatGPT and Google Bard,"With the popularity of ChatGPT, the use of AI has increased across the globe.

And to craft a successful SEO plan, knowing <strong>which on-page element carries the most weight for SEO </strong>is essential.

So, dive into the following section as we discuss the most important on-page SEO factor for top SERP ranking and other influential on-page SEO elements!
<h3><strong>Different Types Of SEO</strong></h3>
Before jumping into on-page SEO factors, let’s learn a little about different types of SEO.

Some experts may tell you there are four types of SEO, while others say there are five. However, there are primarily three categories of SEO every digital marketer should know about.

<strong>• On-page SEO</strong>: As the name suggests, on-page SEO is all about on-site or content SEO. It refers to site-related tasks, such as writing content, internal linking and adding images.

<strong>• Off-page SEO</strong>: Off-page SEO includes the tasks you complete outside of the website, like creating a Google My Business listing and link building.

<strong>• Technical SEO</strong>: Technical SEO refers to on and off-site tasks that impact a website, such as page indexing and speed optimisation.
<h3><strong>Which On-Page Element Carries The Most Weight For SEO?</strong></h3>
On-page SEO has several best practices to tick off to rank your website. But, if you ask which on-page element carries the most weight for SEO, most experts will tell you it’s the title tag.
<h3><strong>What Is A Title Tag? Why Is It Important?</strong></h3>
Title tags are HTML elements that indicate the context of a web page. Only 7.4% of top-ranking pages on Google don’t have a title. The rest know title tags carry the SEO weight of on-page elements.

Your title tags must accurately sum up the content of a web page. Otherwise, there’s a good chance that Google will rewrite it. And it may or may align with your web page's purpose.

The title tag's importance in SEO is due to the following factors.

<strong>• SERP rankings: </strong>When you search anything on Google, you will notice that some parts of the search results are in a blue font. These are title tags that indicate the topics of a page for readers and search engines and significantly influence SERP rankings.

<strong>• Visibility on web browser tab: </strong>When you open a web page, its title tag shows up in your web browser tab. Acting as a placeholder, it helps users find your web page when they have a lot of tabs opened at once.

<strong>• Social media networks relevance: </strong>The title tag also shows up when someone shares your website link on social media. An interesting title tag can help you generate more leads through your SMM.
<h3><strong>How To Write An Efficient Title Tag?</strong></h3>
To write a good title tag, you should try to:

<strong>• Write unique titles: </strong>Ensure the tag represents each page precisely. Customise the tags to make them more unique but easy to understand for users and search engines.

<strong>• Optimise them with keywords: </strong>Include the keywords you’re targeting for individual pages. However, avoid keyword stuffing.

<strong>• Be careful with the length: </strong>Keep the character length of the title tag within 60-70 characters.

<strong>• Be descriptive: </strong>Use the title tag to clearly describe what users will see when they open the page to reduce the bounce rate.
<h3><strong>Other On-Page SEO Best Practices That Carry Significant Weight For SEO</strong></h3>
When you search which on-page element carries the most weight for SEO, you will most likely find a long list of best SEO practices for ranking improvement. These practices are as important as having a title tag or heading tag for your web pages.

<strong>• Meta description: </strong>Meta description's importance in SEO is well-known. Ideally, a meta description should be within 150 to 160 characters and describe the page content accurately for more clicks.

<strong>• Heading tags: </strong>From H1 to H6, heading tags describe the context of your content and make it scalable.

<strong>• URL: </strong>The URL or link of your page is what the users will use to access the website.

<strong>• Keywords: </strong>Without keywords, search engines will not be able to understand or scale your content.

<strong>• Internal links: </strong>Internal links between web content and different pages increase its relevance and authenticity.

<strong>• External links: </strong>Linking your pages and content to other relevant websites increases its credibility.

<strong>• Image: </strong>Optimise your image titles and alt tags to make the content more attractive to readers and search engines.

<strong>• Readability: </strong>Appropriately place keywords, use short sentences, paragraphs and headings and add lists to improve content readability.

130,AI Marketing Myths: Unveiling Where the Marketers Keep Getting Wrong,Uniterrene,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a popular term in marketing today. Businesses consider the use of AI-driven tools for crafting compelling copy and optimizing campaigns. The hype everywhere is that it predicts consumer behavior perfectly and automates the marketing approach. However, there are several <strong>AI Marketing Myths</strong> that you must be aware of.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many marketers overestimate its capabilities. This often leads to disappointments and loss of valuable time. Let’s explore some of the most common myths for you-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Widespread AI Marketing Myths that You Must Know</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>It Produces Flawless Content</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Companies think that <a href=""https://ahrefs.com/writing-tools"" data-type=""link"" data-id=""https://ahrefs.com/writing-tools"">AI writing tools</a> can instantly produce perfect ad copy and blogs. They give importance to generating content even for social posting and make content teams obsolete. However, the truth is that generated content is a draft and lacks originality. The worst part is that it can produce inaccuracies and robotic copy. As a smart marketer, you must treat it as a tool to spark creativity and rely on humans for personalization to connect with audiences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>It Provides Instant Results</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another widespread misconception is that you can achieve instant results by using AI. In reality, it is not a magic bullet that you can trust. Like any tool, it has algorithms designed to provide results that require refinement from time to time. For instance, chatbots improve as users interact and offer sharper recommendations on further queries. So, it is never a quick fix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>It Understands Audiences Better Than Humans</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some companies value AI over humans when it comes to understanding customers. Although it is exceptionally good when you aim at analyzing large data sets, this never offers conclusive responses. It is crucial to correlate with reality, where human interaction is a must.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>It Is the Human Marketer Replacement</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is a prevailing fear that AI is likely to replace human marketers. In reality, there is no logic in it. You can treat it as a tool to generate content and automate tasks faster than humans. When it comes to delivering accuracy and targeting audiences, there is no replacement for humans. It lacks personalization, strategic insight, and authenticity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>It Is Complex for Smaller Businesses</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another misconception is that small businesses think the use of advanced AI is out of reach. The truth is that everyone can integrate this tool for chatbots and other needs to run their firms smoothly. With professional help, it becomes possible to eliminate errors. This ensures you align everything with your business objectives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>It Is Only About Automation</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many marketers assume it for complete automation. However, automating posting on social media or sending emails can bring inaccuracies. The truth is to utilize it for predictive analytics &amp; improve personalized experiences for users. This unlocks opportunities to anticipate trends.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>AI Is a Tool, Not a Complete Solution!</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is not a superficial gadget that offers a lot of real value. It is also not a powerful machine to replace humans. You need to use artificial intelligence wisely to make your marketing efforts more efficient. Ensure personalization and go ahead with data-driven tactics. This is how you can achieve success in meeting the user expectations.</p>

142,How Can You Decide Whether Hybrid or Native App Development Is Right for Your Project?,Uniterrene,"
  <p>
    Selecting the right development approach is a key step in building a strong
    mobile presence. Many businesses compare
    <strong>hybrid vs native app development</strong> as they aim to balance
    performance, flexibility, and cost. Each of the two has its handy benefits
    and the final decision rests on the objectives of your project, the time
    frame and the longer term outlook. A systematic analysis assists in
    identifying the approach that has a better value to your target audience and
    anticipated user experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    Learning how each of these strategies functions and what kind of outcomes
    they may provide, you will be able to make a more conscious choice that will
    help your business goals. The obvious comparison makes your mobile solution
    to be founded on a platform that promotes growth, reliability, and
    satisfaction.
  </p>
  <h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">
    <strong>Understanding the Core Difference</strong>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Hybrid applications have a single application that can run on multiple
    platforms whereas native applications are specific to a single platform like
    <a
      href=""https://www.uniterrene.com/app-development/""
      data-type=""link""
      data-id=""https://www.uniterrene.com/app-development/""
      >Android or iOS</a
    >. This variation influences performance, design option and maintenance
    requirements. With this background in mind, it is simpler to integrate the
    development strategy with your project expectations.
  </p>
  <h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">
    <strong>Evaluate Your Project Purpose</strong>
  </h2>
  <p>
    The main purpose of your app is a determining factor.
    <a
      href=""https://cloudinary.com/guides/front-end-development/native-mobile-app-development""
      data-type=""link""
      data-id=""https://cloudinary.com/guides/front-end-development/native-mobile-app-development""
      target=""_blank""
      rel=""noopener""
      >Native development</a
    >
    can be a better choice in case you require high performance on your computer
    to handle graphics intensive applications or gaming. Hybrid development is
    an effective direction of development in projects aimed at accessibility of
    different devices with moderate capabilities.
  </p>
  <h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">
    <strong>Consider User Experience Requirements</strong>
  </h2>
  <p>
    An important determinant of app success is user experience. Native apps are
    usually smoother since it is designed to fit a particular platform, this
    enables the designers and developers to maximize every aspect. Hybrid
    applications are capable of offering the same experience but not necessarily
    the same responsiveness across platforms.
  </p>
  <h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">
    <strong>Analyze Budget and Timeline Needs</strong>
  </h2>
  <p>
    The strategy is usually led by budget and development time. Hybrid
    applications enable you to code once and deploy twice, a factor that can
    help to save money and time. Native apps have to be developed individually
    on each platform which can be more costly but can provide a more quality
    result.
  </p>
  <h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">
    <strong>Assess Long-Term Maintenance</strong>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Each approach has work requirements in terms of maintenance. The hybrid
    applications are also simpler to update because one only needs to make
    changes once. Native apps need to be updated individually on a platform
    basis but would be more integrated with platform updates and new features.
  </p>
  <h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Key Points to Compare</strong></h2>
  <p>Below are key points you may assess to make a clearer decision:</p>
  <ul class=""wp-block-list"">
    <li>Performance expectations and complexity</li>
    <li>Target audience platforms</li>
    <li>Design needs and custom features</li>
    <li>Time available for launch</li>
    <li>Budget allocation</li>
    <li>Future scalability</li>
    <li>Maintenance requirements</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">
    <strong>When Hybrid Development Works Best?</strong>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Hybrid development is effective when you are required to cover a huge number
    of people on platforms without developing individual apps. It is appropriate
    in businesses which need moderate performances, fast launching schedules and
    wider accessibility. The method aids in making flexible changes and
    long-term management that is cost-effective.

    <strong>When Native Development Is the Better Option?</strong>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Native apps are best suited to applications that need high-performance or
    are dependent on high-end features of the device. It also performs quite
    well when user experience is a fundamental requirement and when you have an
    audience that is focused on a particular platform. Native applications are
    more stable and sophisticated.

143,Is Partnering With an SEO Agency Worth It for New Startups?,Uniterrene,"<p>For many new businesses, gaining early visibility can feel challenging. Scarcity of resources and the increased competition which are usually experienced, makes it hard sometimes to create an online presence that will generate consistent attention. This is where partnering with an experienced <strong>Seo agency for startups</strong> may seem like a practical step. A search strategy can be shaped and efforts to focus on content can be directed by an agency and assist in long-term expansion. Nevertheless, lots of founders are concerned about whether they are making the right decision at the start of the investment. This paper describes the expectations of startups, the merits and disadvantages of engaging external assistance, and the selection of options to determine whether the strategy does not contradict the objectives of the early stage.</p>
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Why Startups Consider an SEO Agency</strong></h2>
<p>Startups usually consider agency support since they desire a greater online presence. New businesses can be assisted by the agencies to increase their visibility, organize their web pages, and find early customers. Although it will not be overnight success, consistent growth can build beneficial momentum as a young brand can get to people who are already pursuing similar services. Another very common thing among many early-stage founders is that outside advice gives them a sense of direction at a particularly critical period when all the decisions impact long-term development.</p>
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Benefits of Hiring an SEO Agency</strong></h2>
<p>Cooperation with an agency can help to create a well-structured site and increase search promotion. Agencies tend to assist in the development of content that aligns with the user intent and monitor the performance periodically to determine what is to be optimised. Startups also save time with technical and strategic labor being performed by specialists, whereas founders are able to concentrate on the creation of a product and customer demands. The agency also is able to scale as the company grows and hence it is very easy to maintain a clear and consistent online presence. Such unwavering support enables the new businesses to win the confidence of the prospective customers and earn some level of credibility in the course of time.</p>
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Possible Limitations</strong></h2>
<p>Despite obvious benefits, there exists a limit as to when an agency should be hired. SEO is a long process and new companies should not have high anticipations of growth. There is a variation in costs and some agencies might not be equal to initial estimates. Startups should ensure that the agency get to know their intentions and give them realistic chances of what they can accomplish in the initial few months. Also founders should remain engaged in the process. Although the agency does the execution part, the startup must lead in terms of messaging, target audience, and priorities. This type of a partnership is most effective when the insight and outcomes are shared and agreed upon.</p>
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>How to Decide if an Agency Is Right for Your Startup</strong></h2>
<p>Founders need to consider his or her objectives, inner competence, and time before selecting an agency. In case the team does not have the knowledge or resources to handle search visibility, external assistance can be a good idea. In the cases where there are not enough funds and the staff is able to make simple enhancements, an in-house solution might be beneficial during the initial stages. The readiness of search visibility to the <a href=""https://asana.com/resources/business-objectives-examples"" data-type=""link"" data-id=""https://asana.com/resources/business-objectives-examples"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">business objectives</a> can also serve to determine the investment as long-term, after reviewing the alignment.</p>
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Key Factors to Consider</strong></h3>
<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li>Your monthly budget and what you can commit long term</li>
<li>The skills and experience your team already has</li>
<li>How soon you expect visibility and growth to improve</li>
<li>The complexity of your product or service</li>
<li>Whether the agency has proven experience working with new businesses</li>
</ul>
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Maximizing the Value of an Agency Partnership</strong></h2>
<p>If a startup decides to work with an agency, clear communication is essential. Establishing objectives at the beginning and tracking progress regularly would help develop a consistent success course. A trustworthy agency must present outcomes in an easy, convenient manner and provide assistance in further development. When both sides know what to expect and strive to achieve mutual results, this is more beneficial to startups. The constant collaboration does not only enhance the performance but also provides a better sense of direction to the startup as it expands.</p>
<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Ready to Strengthen Your Digital Presence with a Trusted Partner?</strong></h2>
<p>Choosing whether to partner with an experienced <strong><a href=""https://www.uniterrene.com/search-engine-optimization/"" data-type=""link"" data-id=""https://www.uniterrene.com/search-engine-optimization/"">Seo agency for startups</a></strong> depends on a company’s goals, timeline, and available resources.
